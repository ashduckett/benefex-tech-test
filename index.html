                    You need to walk before you can run. So to ease you into SaveSmart, this first easy step is going to be the basics - budgeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want to save, you need a clear idea of what's coming in and where your cash is going out. Before we start thinking about paying off debt,
                    a week away in the sun, or your dream house, all of us first need to know where our money is going before we can put any of it aside.

                    Can it be a bit scary to fully understand your financial picture?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Absolutely! But it's an important first step before you can start to create that budget. You might be worried about how much you owe or how much you are spending, but this
                    is the first big step for you to create a more positive financial future.

                    Make sure your essentials like bills, rent and food are covered every single month before you start to put money aside for the future. Savings are very important to make sure you're looked
                    after in future. But taking care of yourself today is essential too. It's also important to make sure that your budget gives you enough money to pay off any money you owe.

                    entire monthly outgoings vs. your monthly incomings. If your outgoings surpass your incomings,
                    then you need to take a look at where you're making unnecessary purchases that you could substitute
                    for a more maintainable option - or cut back on altogether. Could you swap your daily Starbucks for a
                    reusable cup and some instant coffee?
